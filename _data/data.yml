        # link: "#hook"
        tagline: "We found the important factors that affects dating period and predicted dating period. First, we asked 21 questions about realtionship to 311 college students. The questions included religion, major, how often they meet, distance between smoking habit. Then we analyzed the results with the following three algorithms - Multiple Linear Regression, K-NN Clustering, and CART. The most reliable algorthm is 'Multiple Linear Regression Model' with the highest RMSE(542.75714) compared to other two algorithms."

        tagline: " 논문『O. L. Mangasarian, W. N. Street, and W. H.Wolberg. Breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis via linear programming. Operations Research,43(4):570{577, July-August 1995.』을 참고하여 
        첫 번째로는 논문에 소개된 MSM(Multisurface Method) 모델식을 변형하여 새로운 비선형 계획법 모델을 세워 정확도를 비교하였다.
        두 번째로 569개와 예후 데이터 196개를 다양한 방법의 데이터 마이닝을 이용하여 분석하였다. 
        진단 알고리즘으로는 ANN Classification을 적용하여 97.66%의 정확도를 얻고, 분류 트리로 분류하는 경우 93.23%의 정확도를 얻었다.
        예후 알고리즘으로는 공신경망, 회귀 트리, 로지스틱 회귀를 사용하였다. 인공신경망의 정확도는 0.429, 분류 트리의 정확도는 0.315, 
        로지스틱 회귀의 정확도는 0.23가 나왔다. 전체 데이터 수가 194개로 많지 않고, 이 중에 Non-recurrent로 분류될 확률 78%, Recurrent로 분류될 확률이 22%로 
        재발 환자의 데이터가 너무 적어서 모델의 training이 제대로 되지 않기 때문이다.
